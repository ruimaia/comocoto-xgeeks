## Description  
This project is all about helping businesses handle budget requests without the hassle. By using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, it takes messy email conversations, turns them into clean, structured data, and predicts budgets for new customer requests. Think of it as an AI-powered assistant for managing initial client interactions.  

## Problem  
Imagine a company (like a small-to-medium-sized business) that starts getting tons of budget requests through their website. Great problem to have, right? But here’s the catch: they don’t have the resources to respond quickly to everyone. Manually sifting through emails, understanding specs, and figuring out pricing? Super slow and not scalable.  

## Solution  
We’re solving this with a combo of **LLMs** and **ML** magic:  

1. **Making Sense of the Emails**:  
   - LLMs parse historical email exchanges into structured data, pulling out the important stuff like client specs and requests.  
   - For the demo, we used synthetic data (generated by LLMs) to simulate real-world interactions.  

2. **Predicting Budgets with ML**:  
   - A **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** regressor predicts budgets based on similar past requests. Why KNN? It’s simple and explainable—so you can point out which past requests influenced the prediction.  

3. **Saving Time and Effort**:  
   - Automates the boring parts of budget requests so businesses can focus on bigger things.  
   - Scalable and consistent—no more getting overwhelmed by too many emails.  

This proof-of-concept shows how even smaller businesses can use AI to level up their game, respond faster, and close more deals.
